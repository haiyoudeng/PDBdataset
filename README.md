Experimental protein structures for calculating the ANDIS potential.

A non-redundant structural dataset of 3519 protein chains were used for potential derivation. It was culled by PISCES from Protein Data Bank with pairwise sequence identity < 20%, resolution< 2.0 Ã… and R-factor < 0.25 (only the structures determined by X-ray
crystallography were considered). The original list from PISCES contains about 7000 protein chains. We excluded the proteins with incomplete, missing or non-standard residues and the proteins with length < 30 or >1000 residues.
